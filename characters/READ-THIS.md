# What are these?
As I have just found out, these are HeroMachine 2.5 Character Dumps. I'm fully assuming these were conceptual and not actual character designs. I willl end up uploading some of these character concepts as `.png` files. For now, follow the instructions below.

## How do I, well, see these?

- To load these, download the Flash Player projecter content debugger from [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html).
- Run the app and press `File > Open` and input this URL: http://www.heromachine.com/hm2/heromachine.swf
- Once the URL has been inputted, HeroMachine will load. 
- Select `Load` from the HeroMachine menu. 
- Copy the contents of `ira.txt` or any character text file, then paste them in the field.

Congratulations! If it all worked, everything should be in place for you to view the concept art.
