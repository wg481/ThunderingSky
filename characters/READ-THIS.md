# What are these?
As I have just found out, these are HeroMachine 2.5 Character Dumps. According to nitrodragon himself, he prefers the anime style rather than these styles. Feel free to view in two ways.

## How do I, well, see these?

### Method 1
 - Download the `.png` file.
 - Admire.

### Method 2 (least recommended)
For this method, channel your inner perfectionist. This method is seriously nor recommended as it takes way longer, but whatever floats your boat.
- Download the `Flash Player projecter content debugger` from [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html).
- Run the app and press `File > Open` and input this URL: http://www.heromachine.com/hm2/heromachine.swf
- Once the URL has been inputted, HeroMachine will load. 
- Select `Load` from the HeroMachine menu. 
- Copy the contents of `ira.txt` or any character text file, then paste them in the field.

Congratulations! If it all worked, everything should be in place for you to view the concept art.
