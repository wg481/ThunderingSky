# Thundering Sky

Thundering Sky is an in-development 8-bit Japanese-Style Role Playing Game reminiscent of NES JRPG games such as Final Fantasy, Dragon Warrior, and Secret of Mana.

The game is currently on hold, as we've learned that two weeks of LWJGL knowledge doesn't quite add up to a full '80s-style JRPG.

## WG481's Note
Hey all, WG481 here. I forked this repository to keep some state of it in development. Since branch:master has had no commits in the last four years, I'm modernizing the the character tools and maybe editing some of the LWGJL. I certaintly won't be doing anything monumental, but this is my fork of Thundering Sky.
