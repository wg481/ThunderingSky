# Thundering Sky

Thundering Sky is an in-development 8-bit Japanese-Style Role Playing Game reminiscent of NES JRPG games such as Final Fantasy, Dragon Warrior, and Secret of Mana.

The game is currently on hold, as we've learned that two weeks of LWJGL knowledge doesn't quite add up to a full '80s-style JRPG.
